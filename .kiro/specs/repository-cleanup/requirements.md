# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to systematically clean up the Curate Events repository by identifying and removing unused legacy code, experimental files, and redundant systems. The repository currently contains a mix of active production code (React frontend + Node.js backend for AI-powered event curation) alongside numerous test files, experimental features, and legacy systems that are no longer in use. The cleanup will improve maintainability, reduce confusion for new developers, and streamline the codebase to focus on the core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the Curate Events project, I want a clean and organized repository structure, so that I can quickly understand the codebase and focus on active development without being distracted by legacy code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the repository structure THEN the system SHALL identify all unused test files, experimental code, and legacy systems
2. WHEN categorizing files THEN the system SHALL distinguish between active production code and unused/legacy code
3. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL preserve all files that are actively used by the main application
4. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL maintain the integrity of the core React frontend and Node.js backend functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new team member joining the project, I want clear documentation of what systems are active and what has been removed, so that I can understand the current architecture without confusion from legacy references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting the cleanup THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive list of removed files and their purposes
2. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL remove references to deleted systems from README files
3. WHEN preserving documentation THEN the system SHALL keep all documentation related to active systems
4. WHEN finalizing cleanup THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the cleaned repository structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want to ensure that no active dependencies or imports are broken during cleanup, so that the application continues to function correctly after cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify all import statements and file references in active code
2. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL verify that no active code imports or references the files being deleted
3. WHEN testing cleanup THEN the system SHALL ensure the main application (frontend and backend) still builds and runs correctly
4. WHEN validating removal THEN the system SHALL check that all package.json scripts and configuration files remain functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to preserve important experimental work and configuration files that might be needed in the future, so that valuable research and setup work is not lost permanently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying experimental code THEN the system SHALL distinguish between abandoned experiments and potentially valuable research
2. WHEN handling configuration files THEN the system SHALL preserve all active configuration files and templates
3. WHEN archiving content THEN the system SHALL create an archive or documentation of significant experimental work before deletion
4. WHEN making decisions THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for files that are unclear whether they should be kept or removed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with the cleaned repository, I want a logical and consistent file organization, so that I can easily locate and work with the code I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing remaining files THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent directory structure and naming conventions
2. WHEN grouping files THEN the system SHALL organize related functionality together (frontend components, backend routes, etc.)
3. WHEN finalizing structure THEN the system SHALL ensure all remaining files serve a clear purpose in the active application
4. WHEN documenting organization THEN the system SHALL update any documentation to reflect the new clean structure
