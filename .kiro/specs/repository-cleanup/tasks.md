# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create dependency analysis system
  - Build a TypeScript utility to scan all active source files for import statements and file references
  - Parse package.json scripts to identify actively used script files
  - Integrate dead code detection tools like vulture for Python files and similar tools for JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Create a comprehensive list of all files that are actively referenced by the production codebase
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Implement file classification engine
  - Create classification rules for different file categories (active, test, experimental, legacy, config)
  - Build a file classifier that can categorize files based on path patterns, content analysis, and dependency status
  - Integrate automated dead code detection using tools like vulture (Python), ts-unused-exports (TypeScript), unimported (frontend unused files), knip (comprehensive unused code detection), and depcheck (Node.js dependencies)
  - Implement confidence scoring for classification decisions combining static analysis with tool results
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 3. Build safety validation system
  - Create validation logic to ensure no active code imports files marked for deletion
  - Implement build integrity checks to verify the application still compiles after file removal
  - Use comprehensive frontend analysis tools like unimported, ts-unused-exports, knip, and ESLint unused-imports to validate frontend code safety before removal
  - Add dependency violation detection to prevent breaking active functionality
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [-] 4. Create backup and archiving system
  - Implement backup creation functionality to save current repository state before cleanup
  - Build archiving system for experimental code that should be preserved for reference
  - Create restoration capability in case cleanup needs to be rolled back
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement cleanup execution engine
  - Build file removal functionality with batch processing and validation between batches
  - Create cleanup report generation to document what was removed and why
  - Implement documentation updates to remove references to deleted systems
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 6. Remove obvious test files safely
  - Identify and remove all test-*.js, test-*.py, and test-*.html files
  - Remove debug files, log files, and temporary artifacts
  - Clean up conflicted copies and PID files
  - Validate build integrity after each removal batch
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Clean up experimental and demo code
  - Archive valuable content from experiments/ directory before removal
  - Remove demo_outputs/, experiments/, and prototype files
  - Clean up performance testing and multi-provider testing files
  - Update documentation to remove references to experimental systems
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 2.1_

- [ ] 8. Remove legacy systems and migrations
  - Remove SQL migration files and legacy database scripts
  - Clean up old API files (apply-*.js) and migration helpers
  - Remove unused Python scripts and old configuration files
  - Preserve only active configuration templates and current system files
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 9. Organize remaining file structure
  - Ensure consistent directory structure and naming conventions
  - Group related functionality together logically
  - Verify all remaining files serve a clear purpose in the active application
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 10. Update documentation and generate final report
  - Update README.md to remove references to deleted systems
  - Preserve documentation for active systems and current architecture
  - Generate comprehensive cleanup report showing what was removed and space saved
  - Document the new clean repository structure for future developers
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 11. Validate complete system functionality
  - Run full build tests for both frontend and backend
  - Test all package.json scripts to ensure they work correctly
  - Verify development environment setup still functions properly
  - Confirm no broken imports or missing dependencies exist
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 1.4_
